## 🏗️ Core Architecture: Three-Entity System

**Brand → Persona → Agent**

This is a **KEY DIFFERENTIATOR** and must be reflected in the UI:

1. **Brand** - Client's business identity, values, voice
2. **Persona** - Specific character/role for different use cases
3. **Agent** - Deployed AI voice agent using the persona

**Why it matters:**
- Guaranteed consistency across campaigns
- Faster agent deployment
- Reusable personas across clients
- Clear separation of concerns

**UI Implication:** Brand, Persona, and Agent pages must feel interconnected and show clear hierarchy.

## 🎯 Strategic Narrative

### Market Shift
"Marketing changed faster than agencies could keep up"

**Yesterday → Today:**

### The Problem
Agencies are drowning in:
- ❌ Fragmented tools
- ❌ Manual fulfillment
- ❌ Low margins
- ❌ Client churn
- ❌ Slow lead-to-opportunity time
- ❌ Human-dependent follow-ups

### The Category Insight
**"The Death of Manual Campaigns"**

Marketing execution is no longer a human task — it's an AI-driven continuous loop.

## 🎨 IMPACT ON FRONTEND DEVELOPMENT

### Why UI Polish Matters

- ✅ **Agency credibility**

Poor UI = Lost agency deals = Lost $10K-50K MRR clients
